# Angular 2 & Webpack

##### [![npm version](https://d25lcipzij17d.cloudfront.net/badge.svg?id=js&type=6&v=2.0.2&x2=0)](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/2.0.2)

A slightly more advanced Angular 2 starter seed using Webpack.

> This seed uses ng2 router `3.0.2`

## Pre-installed libraries

* RxJS

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

Running your dev server, by default your app will be hosted at `http://localhost:5000`

```bash
npm start
```

Deploying your build

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a new folder `build` in your project. These files need to be uploaded to your online webserver.

> You don't need to upload the .js.map & .css.map files onto your server.
